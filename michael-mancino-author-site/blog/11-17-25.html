        <div class="post-content">
<p>If Jonah is the brain, Hayes is the firepower.</p>

<p>Master Sergeant Mat Hayes. Former Ranger. Former Green Beret. Former Delta. Former CIA Ground Branch. Wannabe GunTuber. The guy who's been through every tier of special operations and walked away with an arsenal, a rolodex, a compound near Austin, and absolutely zero patience for bureaucratic bullshit.</p>

<p>He's also Jonah's closest ally. The brother-in-arms who shows up when called, no questions asked, because that's what you do.</p>

<p>Hayes is what I call "bro energy meets the apocalypse." Shaved head with a mohawk strip, trimmed beard, Grunt Style T-shirts and American flag short-shorts under tactical pants. The kind of guy who'd crack a joke about demon-worshipping billionaires while loading magazines for an assault on an Egyptian temple complex.</p>

<p>The inspiration for Hayes came to me from a combination of Mat Best – a former Army Ranger and GunTuber comedian – and a friend and former coworker named Mike. Mike is a former SWAT guy turned contractor and has a similar humor to Mat Best, if not much darker, and a no-fucks-given attitude.</p>

<p>"Fuck me, this keeps getting better."</p>

<p>That's Hayes. Sarcastic commentary on nightmare scenarios. It's not that he doesn't take threats seriously, he does. But gallows humor is how we cope. You laugh or you break, and Hayes learned that lesson downrange a long time ago.</p>

<p>What makes him work as a character is that he's loyal without being a yes-man. When Jonah's spiraling, Hayes calls him on it. When Jonah's making tactical mistakes, Hayes pushes back. But when Jonah needs backup, no matter how insane the mission, Hayes is there. And he brings his toys.</p>

<p>Their dynamic reflects real operator culture. The brotherhood forged under fire. The shorthand communication that comes from shared experience. The ability to function as a team without needing constant verbal coordination.</p>

<p>Hayes brings the gear. The connections. The experience. He's the one who provides Jonah with military-grade night vision, encrypted comms, and his weapons. He's got access to equipment that shouldn't be available to civilians—but when you've spent decades in black ops, you build networks.</p>

<p>His compound near Austin serves as a base of operations. Hayes has set up an invite-only world-class training facilities, an armory that would make the Ranger Battalion jealous, and a safe location for planning missions that would get most people arrested.</p>

<p>When Jonah calls about demons being real, Hayes doesn't laugh. Doesn't dismiss it. Just loads the right ammunition and adjusts tactics. Because if your brother says there's a threat, you believe him until proven otherwise.</p>

<p>The supernatural doesn't intimidate Hayes because he's seen humans do worse. Demons torture and kill? So do cartels. Entities possess people? He's watched what methamphetamine psychosis does. The horror is real, but it's not fundamentally different from the horrors he's already faced.</p>

<p>BROKEN CREED launches January 1, 2026. Pre-order now and meet the team.</p>

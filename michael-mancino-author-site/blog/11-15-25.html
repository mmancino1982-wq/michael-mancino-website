<p>Jonah Creed isn't your typical protagonist.</p>

<p>He's not a superhero. He's not chosen. He's not special in any meaningful way except that he died once and came back marked by things that don't forget.</p>

<p>Former Army HUMINT collector. DLI graduate, fluent Arabic, self-taught Aramaic. Deployed to Fallujah where an IED sent him on a guided tour of Hell—not metaphorical, not PTSD-induced hallucination. Actual Hell. The woman nailed to the cross. The Guide's laugh echoing through red-lit chambers. The kind of shit that doesn't fade with time or therapy.</p>

<p>Twenty years later, he's a PI in Houston. Functional alcoholic. PTSD that he can't separate from genuine supernatural whispers. His dead mentor keeps appearing—turns out he's been hallucinating Marcus Hale for years, the real man died while Jonah was locked in a VA psych ward.</p>

<p>That's the foundation. A man who can't trust his own perceptions trying to investigate reality-bending horror.</p>

<p>What I wanted with Jonah was someone competent but not superhuman. He's good at what he does—interrogation, tradecraft, piecing together patterns. But he gets overwhelmed. He asks for help. He makes mistakes that cost lives. He doesn't have plot armor.</p>

<p>His internal monologue is sharp, sarcastic, self-critical. Stream-of-consciousness processing that reflects how operators actually think under stress—not clean narrative, but fragmented assessment and dark humor as defense mechanism.</p>

<p><em>""What the fuck am I doing here? All-loving, huh? FUCK YOU!""</em></p>

<p>That's Jonah in the moment. Raw. Angry. Broken but still swinging.</p>

<p>He's marked by both sides now—Hell from the NDE, Heaven after surviving a possession attempt. That makes him visible. Useful. A target. Neither side controls him, but both know his name.</p>

<p>The book follows him investigating what starts as corporate espionage and escalates into global conspiracy involving ritual murder and human trafficking. By the time he realizes how deep it goes, people he cares about are already dead.</p>

<p>Something intense happens to Jonah later in the book. Something I don't want to spoil if you haven't read the book.</P

<p>Jonah breaks. Goes ice-cold. ""Camera mode""—recording everything, feeling nothing, because feeling would shatter him completely.</p>

<p>That's the Jonah readers meet in the final act.</p>

<p>He's not a hero. He's a broken man in a broken world doing broken things because someone has to.</p>

<p>BROKEN CREED is my story, from his point of view. The supernatural elements aren't fantasy worldbuilding—they're processed trauma. The possession scene is based on my real experience in 2025. The Hell tour happened during the height of depression when I slipped into what I can only describe as an out of body experience. Jonah's struggle to separate mental illness and fragility from genuine supernatural guidance mirrors my own.</p>

<p>I wanted a protagonist who reflects the reality of what deployment does to you. The hypervigilance. The survivor's guilt. The inability to turn off the threat assessment even when you're stateside. The dark humor that keeps you functional when everything else says quit.</p>

<p>Jonah asks for help. That's his strength. Surrender—not to enemies, but to the reality that he can't do this alone. He teams with fellow operators. He accepts guidance from others, including those that are themselves supernatural. He uses modern tools like AI, drones, etc.</p>

<p>Partnership, not transaction. Even when fighting cosmic horror.</p>

<p>That's Jonah Creed. Competent but mortal. Marked, not chosen. Broken but standing.</p>

<p>BROKEN CREED launches January 1, 2026. Pre-orders live now.</p>

<p>This is what happens when the darkness follows you home.</p>
